# JavaScript roulette

## About
<p>I designed this basic website to explore a circular button placement pattern in CSS. The process involves an initial rotation, a translation along the X axis and finally reverting the rotation of each element, from the centre of a circle, to it's periphery.</p>
<p>I am also experimenting with setInterval/clearInterval methods, changing the button colours at regular intervals.</p>
<p>I've also created an index.php file to "trick" Heroku into thinking this is a dynamic page</p>
